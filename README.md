Quantfind -- Neural Network Matlab Implementation

Neural Network Implementation from Coursera Machine Learning class. 

The program implemented a two-layer neural network with 25 hidden nodes and 10 labels to recognize hand-written digits. The algorithm runs for 50 iterations, achieving 95.7% accuracy on the training set. (The program also shows a visualizaion of hidden layer)

To execute:

1. Clone repo
2. Open in Matlab, and run ex4.m
